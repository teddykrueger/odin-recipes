The current project is to create a website for recipes.
So far I have learned the basics of HTML
With this project I demonstrate my proficiency with setting up a basic HTML website using the skills I have acquired throughout this lesson.
Skills I seek to demonstrate:
    Setting up index page
    Use of text emphasis
    Use of paragraphs 
    Use of headers
    Inserting links
    Embedding images
