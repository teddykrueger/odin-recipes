        <p> The Golden Girls was a quintessential part of my childhood. I can recall countless times I watched the girls spend many an evening, morning, midday, and sometimes middle of the night around their infamous kitchen table indulging in a slice of cheesecake. Over the course of the show, cheesecake became not only a trope but a symbol of vulnerability and strength. This recipe is an ode to the girls and its impact on generations to come. </p>
