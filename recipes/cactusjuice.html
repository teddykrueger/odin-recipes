            <p><em>“Drink cactus juice! It’ll quench ya. Nothing’s quenchier. It’s the quenchiest!” -Sokka </em></p>
        <h3>History of the Drink</h3>
            
            <p> <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Cactus_juice">Cactus Juice</a> is a naturally occurring liquid found in certain succulent plants of the Si Wong Desert. It contains hallucinogens which cause those who consume it to temporarily fall into a deranged mental state.</p>
            <p>In Season 2 Episode 11 of Avatar: The Last Airbender, Sokka and Momo consume juice from a cactus to quench their thirst. Little did they know the plant possesses hallucinogenic effects when consumed which led to an afternoon of tripping in the desert for the pair. </p>
